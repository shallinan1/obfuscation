["Instead of instructing with rote lectures, handouts, worksheets, and lesson plans, a Montessori teacher will offer guidance, but the child is ultimately responsible for his or her own individual learning.", "The classroom will often contain several stations, each containing toys which allow children to explore and learn.", "For example, a common station in a Montessori classroom will have a bucket of Lego blocks and several pictures of simple objects like an apple or a house, which the children can build if they want.", "Other stations might have books, crayons, a xylophone, or other engaging activities.", "The whole idea behind the Montessori classroom is allowing children to learn through playing."]
["Once information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to.", "For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually.", "In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room.", "There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly."]
