["This support often is vertical and often doesn't take the full IDP situation into account.", "In fact, over 50% of African countries did not mention their IDPs in their HIV National Strategic Plans and Global Fund proposals  indicating a lack of awareness of the need to build capacity for this portion of the population within their borders.", "This goes largely back to the issue of location.", "IDPs are often in inaccessible areas where governments don't have health programs and don't have the funds to initiate them.", "In addition, countries have a basic responsibility to care for refugees, based on the 1951 refugee convention but no such mandate exists for IDPs.", "As an anecdotal example, the WHO cited one of the failings with the Kenya emergency response in 2007 to be that the emergency response plan was only 28% funded."]
["In response to some of these issues, the World Bank has issued grants for a number of projects that include micro-financing for healthcare services in IDP situations.", "Generally these grants pay to rehabilitate the physical structures, often in conjunction with schools and other buildings that offer similar services.", "However, these sorts of grants generally are post-conflict.", "Effective financing mechanisms during conflict to ensure access for the most vulnerable is largely done through grants and donations to NGOs or UN services where the country's health infrastructure is insufficient."]
["In many conflict zones, NGOs \"pick up the slack\" in providing healthcare services to citizens and IDPs.", "This is reliant on government cooperation and funding, whether via grants or private funding.", "In these frequent situations, coordination between agencies is of the utmost importance, as is earning the trust and commitment of country leadership.", "When collaboration with the government does not exist, NGOs can find it impossible to work.", "In March 2009, in response to President Omar Al-Bashir's indictment by the International Criminal Court, 13 major aid organizations were kicked out of the country, including Medecines Sans Frontiers, OXFAM, CARE, Save The Children, and the IRC.", "This expulsion left 1.5 million people without access to healthcare, according to the UN.", "Most of these organizations were never allowed back into the Sudan, leaving much smaller NGOs to take over programming for health and education services, which they were not equipped for.", "Similarly, in 2009 Ethiopia suspended the operations of around 40 NGOs, (mostly smaller organizations) for operations \"outside of their mandate\".", "While these sorts of situations occur infrequently, it does point to one of the real issues with the reliance on NGOs in conflict situations.", "If the government does not support their mission, they can be kicked out, leaving vulnerable populations without access to basic health care."]
["One area that is of particular concern is that of providing reproductive health in IDP and refugee situations.", "Due to the ever-changing US government stance on the \"Mexico City Policy,\" also known as the \"Global Gag Rule,\"  which is the refusal to fund organizations involved in any sort of abortion programming, reproductive health can be a difficult area for many NGOs reliant on USAID funding to work in."]
["In addition, According to N Hakamies, \"Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.\"", "Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies."]
["Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations.", "The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide.", "Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming."]
["There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced.", "Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period.", "In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else.", "This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway."]
["Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage.", "NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however.", "The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations."]
["Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs).", "Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care.", "They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use.", "According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, \"In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted.", "This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services\".", "MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community.", "These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting."]
["Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005.", "In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held."]
["In addition, the only aid group they allowed to enter the region was the ICRC.", "For these reasons, it was clear that they needed the mobility the MHUs afforded them to ensure basic services were offered to as many citizens in the occupied areas as possible."]
["The point above is reiterated multiple times in Du Mortier and Coninx's article: the reason why MHUs were deemed acceptable in this case is because they were used as the only option.", "Du Mortier and Coninx stress in their document that MHUs should not be used to substitute Ministry of Health programming, but to supplement those services only in exceptional situations where access is restricted, as a last resort, if you will.", "They identify very specific targets that MHUs can be used to accomplish."]
["Substitution: As  described in the example above, where federal health programming is unable to reach citizens and IDPs, MHUs can be viewed as a temporary stopgap measure.", "In this case, the organization is acting as a replacement of services for leaders."]
["Support: In these cases, MHUs are used as a supplemental clinic to help officials meet their goals.", "This generally entails the establishment of common objectives between the government and the NGO which can realistically be supplemented in part by the use of MHUs."]
["Mobilization: In these cases, services are provided without the direct input of government officials.", "Support is developed among third parties that can exert pressure on government officials to take over and provide services."]
["It is important to note that regardless of the underlying targets, MHUs must not be viewed as permanent solutions, due to the limitations in numbers of services provided and high operating costs.", "In other words, MHUs are not viable stand-alone units that should be viewed as a part of the country's health infrastructure.", "MHUS are specifically to be used when there is no other option, and retired once the situation has stabilized."]
["There are many other considerations which are important to be aware of when deciding how and when to use MHUs.", "Du Mortier and Coninx highlight a few of these."]
["MHUs are often more successful for vertical programming.", "More specifically, MHUs are extremely good at screening and vaccinating for serious conditions that are slow to develop.", "Treatment for patients in the acute stage is not a recommended primary strategy for MHUs, largely due to the fact that they are only intermittently available for any population to access.", "Obviously, MHUs will deal with acute illnesses in many cases, but this is not their strength and should not be viewed as a primary acute care tool in the planning stage.", "This focus on preventative care is an important takeaway, and its usefulness in preventing communicable disease through screenings and vaccinations is a clear asset of this model.", "To this point, Du Mortier and Coninx make the following caveat:"]
["As indicated by the mention of triage above, staff in MHUs must be highly trained.", "In addition, access to a nearby clinic for referral is critical."]
["As stated by Du Mortier and Coninx:"]
["Du Mortier and Coninx go on to say that in their experience, patients will likely refuse transport \tto a clinic due to fears about where they are going and their ability to return to their families, \tbut the option to receive further treatment is important for the clinic to be viewed as a legitimate \thealthcare option."]
["Du Mortier and Coninx are also very careful to state that MHUs should not be viewed as an evaluation tool.", "MHUs do not provide assessments as to the state of health in an area, but are a treatment intervention ONLY."]
["As evidenced by Mortier and Coninx, MHUs are useful tools for providing some basic preventative and (barring any other options) acute health care when access is otherwise unavailable.", "It is important to reiterate that MHUs should be viewed as a last resort in providing medical services during conflict, not as a first option, which may often be the case when planning for interventions in conflict situations, due to their perceived flexibility."]
["The importance of providing mental health care, and screening for IDPs suffering from emotional issues is important for many reasons, one of which is the high rate of prevalence.", "In one study on survivors of the Kosovo conflict, it was found that of participants in one study:"]
["While it may seem obvious, survivors of conflict situations often have very specific mental health needs.", "Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) has integrated mental healthcare into their emergency response module.", "Community level workers are \"trained to identify and refer cases of mental disorders and epilepsy to the MSF mobile health clinics where the mental health team provided proper diagnosis and treatment.\".", "In Mueller's study, referrals to MSF in the Mindanao region of the Philippines were tracked, with 96% of those treated for emotional distress reporting a traumatic event, ( 54% home evacuation, 26% conflict, 5% destruction of property).", "The patients were tracked throughout brief psychotherapy sessions, and the results showed a marked improvement (via their scores on a self-reporting questionnaire)."]
["What are the implications of this study?", "Not only is the provision of mental healthcare during conflict situations feasible, but it is proven to be effective.", "The WHO has recommended incorporating mental health as one of the screening services offered by MHU, with referrals to trained mental health professionals as seen fit.", "It seems that adding mental health screening to MHU tasks has been shown in programming to be an effective tool for the future.", "Clearly, immediate conflict response focuses on morbidity and mortality, and rightly so.", "The international community, however, has correctly identified mental health as an important and under-appreciated aspect of conflict response and is taking steps to ensure those aspects are addressed moving forward."]
["In light of the many issues that make health service provision so difficult in IDP settings, it is useful to identify successes amid the confusion.", "In Understanding effects of armed conflict on health outcomes: the case of Nepal, Bhimsen Devkota and Edward R van Teijlingen find one such case."]
["Nepal was embroiled in a bloody civil war from 1996 until 2006.", "Surprisingly, however, they are still on track to meet 16 of the 19 Millennium Development Goals by 2015.", "While they are unlikely to meet the reproductive health targets, some of the goals Nepal is on track to meet include under-five and maternal mortality targets and disease-specific goals (halting the spread of HIV and malaria).", "The question is, how was Nepal able to meet these targets even when dealing with civil conflict and internally displaced people?"]
["Devotka and van Teijlingen identify multiple reasons why Nepal was successful even during such trying times.", "Some of the relevant items with regard to maintaining and strengthening health systems include:"]
["Neither side purposely disrupted health systems during the conflict.", "Though the conflict led to a decrease in service utilization, due to access problems, the rebels overall looked favorably on health services and made no efforts to deny access to citizens during the fighting."]
["The rebels made an effort to ensure health clinics in their area were still sufficiently staffed and supplied.", "Most clinics in rebel-held areas were sufficiently staffed and had supplies.", "While many of the clinics were operated without trained health professionals, they still received regular training and supplies."]
["Key actors increased coordination in response to the conflict, while maintaining a low profile.", "Regular meetings continued between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and community officials.", "In addition, the international organizations that responded by providing services kept a low profile.", "The one issue identified here, however, is the lack of clarity coming from the country level to all actors.", "While provisions were made for free care to poor citizens, criteria as to who qualified was not laid out to clinics.", "Similarly, communication between the MOH and international organizations was not identified as a strength of the program."]
["Public health and more traditional service providers also increased their efforts during the conflict.", "In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict.", "Programming for the elderly and indigent was increased, and many traditional female \"attendants\" saw their role increased."]
["GDP in the country continued to rise during the extended conflict, and infrastructure improvements likely also contributed.", "These factors likely helped the country stay on track for the MDGs.", "The infrastructure improvements (roads and electricity) likely improved access for many citizens."]
["There are clear lessons for developing a health systems strengthening approach in other conflict situations here.", "Namely, commitment from both sides of the conflict to not disrupting the health provision infrastructure in the country is key.", "Ensuring clinics still run and funds are in place can help to minimize the effects of access and migration.", "In addition, the government must be able to hand off some of the management to provincial or community levels, especially in rebel-held zones where they have limited access."]
["So what are the takeaways from the Nepal case study?"]
["Was this situation an aberration, or can health status continue to improve event during armed conflict within a country?", "Devkota and Teijlingen think that the lessons learned by analyzing Nepal's approach towards health systems during civil war can indeed be applied elsewhere, and for good reason.", "At the end of the day, the primary takeaway message is that of coordination, a common theme even in the most stable of countries when discussing health systems.", "Coordination among the Ministry of Health and community offices, passing off duties when appropriate.", "Coordination between the Ministry of Health and international agents, such as the UN or NGOs.", "However, the conflict in Nepal had its own set of rules that likely don't exist in other areas."]
["In Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, NGO workers are regularly held hostage or killed due to their perceived western ties.", "In many conflicts aid organizations are often viewed as a target.", "In Nepal, the NGOs tended to keep a low profile which might have helped in this case.", "Of course, the bigger issue is involvement by both sides of the conflict.", "The idea that both sides will choose not to interfere with healthcare provision is simply unrealistic in many areas of the world.", "While utilizing the existing healthcare infrastructure as Nepal was able to do would be ideal, in genocides, such as in Rwanda or the Sudan, expecting both sides of the conflict to make efforts not to impede healthcare access is unrealistic."]
["In addition, Nepal's situation was unlike many countries dealing with internal conflict and IDPs.", "The effect of the continued growth of the national GDP cannot be understated, as the relationship between increased GDP and increased health indicators (such as the MDGs Nepal is on track to meet) is quite close.", "While internal conflict  would certainly mitigate some of the expected improvements due to GDP, those increases, as well as the infrastructure investments, likely played an important role in helping health status continue to improve through the ten year war."]
["There are some takeaways from Nepal and the other literature reviewed that can be applied to  all conflict situations, however.", "Firstly, increasing preventative care is of clear importance, as was also seen in the discussion of using MHUs in IDP situations.", "Vaccinations and screenings can do much to stop the spread of infectious diseases before a full-fledged outbreak of malaria occurs.", "In addition to preparation and disease monitoring, flexibility in these sorts of volatile, unpredictable situations is a clear priority."]
["The sorts of special considerations in Afghanistan and the Sudan should not be viewed as insurmountable obstacles.", "In an ideal world (more Nepal than some of the other cases) conflict would not affect citizens' access to healthcare and qualified health workers.", "However, as seen, there are real consequences that can be expected when internal conflict erupts (geographic and financial barriers and the brain drain).", "The international community has certainly worked hard at establishing frameworks for working in these sorts of situations, but there is still work to be done in developing plans to mitigate the long-term effects of some of these issues."]
