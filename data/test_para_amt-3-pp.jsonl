["High levels of education in certain areas of China and Russia plus a national broadband system and a government which may not support, but at least condones, computer crime against foreign nationals also lead to the majority of real threats originating from these areas."]
["Most hackers are young, under thirty.", "The reasons for this are uncertain, but it is known that their respective governments recruit the best and brightest hackers as part of their military.", "Hackers who own botnets, malware worms that infest many computers at once and allow the hackers to control them remotely, are usually in business for themselves, selling their services to the highest bidder.", "Services rendered by these botnet operators most commonly include money laundering and denial of service attacks.", "Other hackers are simply guns-for-hire, paid between $1,000 and $5,000 to compromise a specific computer."]
["Hackers are often genius-level students who are creative and enjoy puzzles or challenges.", "Infiltrating a computer system often requires the hacker to practice on similar machines for many hours.", "In many cases, the hacker will read through the actual programming code that the machine uses until something sticks out as wrong.", "This is usually due to a programmer error, but these are often overlooked when many individual programmers work on a single piece of code.", "More novice hackers read the latest security reports from Microsoft and simply attack unpatched computers before the computers have a chance to install the updates.", "These programs are often distributed among the hacker community as ways to break into certain systems.", "Many of these programs are freely available on the Internet today for any novice interested in getting started as a hacker."]
["Some hackers do not attack the computer systems at all, preferring to manipulate the human behind the system instead.", "These hackers, known as social engineers, are usually behind most of the phishing and pharming scams on the Internet."]
["Hackers come in two varieties, called black hat and white hat.", "The black hat hackers are the criminal element, doing things that are illegal or immoral in order to make money or simply for vandalism.", "White hat hackers are often individuals hacking for the fun or the challenge with no intention to harm any of the computers they compromise.", "It's proper etiquette in the white hat community to send instructions on how to patch the hole to the administrator of a compromised system via an email from his own account."]

["The \"Do Not Track\" bill introduced in the House of Representatives would ban advertisers from tracking the behavior of users who opt-out of ad tracking for marketing purposes."]
["The possibility that Internet users will be able to hide what they do from the ubiquitous ad tracking is a big win for consumers concerned with Internet privacy."]
["Lawmakers have heralded the bill as a companion to the \"Do Not Call\" registry that was introduced in 2003.", "The registry prevented telemarketers from calling consumers who chose to opt-out from telemarketing calls.", "The \"Do Not Track\" bill would similarly force advertisers to respect the privacy of users who do not want their online activity to be subject to ad network tracking for marketing purposes."]
["According to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), the bill's sponsor, \"Consumers have a right to determine what if any of their information is shared with big corporations, and the federal government must have the authority and tools to enforce reasonable protections.\""]
["The \"Do Not Track\" bill would give the FTC eighteen months to come up with a set of enforceable privacy protection regulations for online ad network tracking.", "Some, like Ryan Calo, director of Stanford Law School's Consumer Privacy Project, believe the bill does not go far enough.", "For one, he said, the bill only applied to those who chose to opt-out from ad network tracking.", "It does not affect those who do not know that they can or do not know how.", "This objection is partially overruled as the newest edition of the Firefox browser makes prevalent a \"Do Not Track Me\" option said to be the response to this and other similar bills."]

["The FBI argues that the current limitations on their wiretapping are antiquated.", "Many statutes have not been updated since the early nineties.", "Some of the statutes allow the FBI to read e-mail stored on a local server that is more than six months old.", "These laws date back to a time when users fetched their mail from a single computer almost daily, so e-mail that had been on a server for six months was considered abandoned.", "In the age of webmail, users keep most of their emails forever."]

["Many, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, believe that this kind of data-mining is the first step toward an Orwellian control over the population.", "The EFF cites a National Research Council paper that concluded \"data mining is a dangerous and ineffective way to identify potential terrorists, which will inevitably generate false positives that subject innocent citizens to invasive scrutiny by their government.\"", "The EFF is a non-profit with a stated goal to protect online privacy."]
