["Thirdly, it is important that the rural insurance scheme be developed to provide at the very least a basic set of services that can be paid for.", "In other words, the insurance scheme will need to ensure from the start that catastrophic costs are not going to cause the entire scheme to fold.", "As undesirable as it may be, that may mean that services will need to be excluded from coverage (for example, paying for outpatient services at clinics but not paying for hospital services).", "Related to this is the consideration mentioned earlier about a waiting period before services can be utilized.", "Another benefit of such a setup would be additional revenue from people unable to use funds yet, helping the insurance scheme stay afloat."]
["Provided Namibia prepare properly and set appropriate targets, pay for performance can be a critical tool in stopping the AIDS epidemic in their country.", "As outlined in this paper, however, when setting targets it is of the utmost importance that benchmarks be analyzed for potential consequences, including unintended effects to the provision of and quality of care.", "It is also important that the country ensure that its health system is both financially and technologically prepared for the additional anticipated stress to its country's healthcare infrastructure."]
["Another contributor to the failing of so many of these sorts of schemes is the administrative stress of developing such schemes.", "For smaller schemes like these sorts of rural insurance organizations, administrative costs are high, owing to the reduced funding pool, and the high administrative needs.", "For instance, most administrators must negotiate rates with providers, set premiums and collect premiums from members, and coordinate recruitment into the scheme.", "As a result, administrative costs and fees often further hamper the organization's viability.", "In addition, the premium fees are often set on the basis of how much the members can pay rather than on the costs of provision of care.", "This means that the administrators must develop a package of services that are covered and decide what is excluded.", "These sorts of issues mean that administration of these insurance schemes really need qualified, experienced administrators that are often lacking in these rural areas.", "A poorly-run scheme with staff that is not up to the task likely will eat up potential funds with administrative fees."]
["Complicating the \"Brain Drain\" problem even further is the traditional issue of physician compensation.", "Even for providers who don't suffer from threats of violence against them, in a place like Iraq today they cannot afford to hold on to the existing doctors.", "As stated by Agron Ferati in the Brookings Institute's 2009 panel, \"Monitoring Health Services among Iraqi Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons,\" \"Why should I remain in Baghdad as a surgeon, when I can go in Dubai and earn $5,000 salary, while in Baghdad I risk my own life, my family's lives, for $600 or $700?\"", "This problem only surface in Iraq after the war.", "This issue is not constrained to only doctors, either.", "In 2006 it was found that only about 30% of all healthcare staff positions were filled."]

["Communicable Disease Prevention - People have access to information and services that are designed to prevent the communicable diseases that contribute most significantly to excess morbidity and mortality.", "(Malaria and Dengue fever are of particular interest here)"]
["Another problem with a pay for performance model is the risk that it might cause some adverse selection.", "If there are performance measures for the percentage of HIV-positive patients on ARVs, for instance, there would be an incentive for providers not to take on new HIV-positive clients to ensure they are still meeting these sorts of ratio benchmarks.", "It is important to keep in mind these sorts of unintended consequences of pay for performance implementation."]
["Increased incidence of endemic disease - Increased morbidity and mortality from diseases like HIV/AIDS."]
["Equity in healthcare refers to the even distribution of access and services across a given group.", "Inequality and inequity are not necessarily the same thing.", "If inequality, among say the rich and the poor are due to financial or time constraints (i.e.", "the poor cannot afford certain services) it can be said that it that is an inequity.", "However, if there is an inequality due to consumer preferences (for example, increased utilization by the poor because they need healthcare services more), this is an inequality that does not indicate inequity.", "As can be noted in the above example, inequality may not always be in favor of the rich.", "In fact, as Rawl's notes, inequality should only be allowed in raising the status of the poor."]
["As of 2005, the number of IDPs in the world was estimated to be 25 million, with another 120 million adversely affected by conflict though not officially displaced.", "In the last 15 years, access to healthcare has improved in conflict situations, but there is still a long way to go.", "4 of the 5 countries with the highest under 5 mortality rate are conflict affected (Sierra Leone, Angola, Afghanistan, and Liberia).", "Just as concerning are the apparent disparities between populations affected differently by the same conflict.", "Healthcare services to internally displaced people has not improved to the same level as services for refugees.", "There are a number of reasons for this.", "IDPs generally don't have a \"hub\" similar to a refugee camp, for example, that would facilitate healthcare service provision.", "In addition, Spiegel points to the \"poor access to services and the absence of mandate and funding for one agency to assume decisive responsibility for non-refugee populations\" as a complicating issue .", "In other words, the lack of an international mandate to serve IDPs, like the one that exists for people deemed worthy of \"refugee\" status, complicates issues.", "Complicating the situation even further, providing care often proves to be costly and difficult for many reasons, some of which are further  discussed below."]
["That being said, there are some pitfalls of the pay for performance model that should be considered in the implementation phase of an HIV/AIDS-based bonus model in Namibia in order to be successful."]
["Cesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.", "The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.", "While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.", "This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.", "Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.", "Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.", "There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.", "Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs."]
["In terms of supply security and logistics, conflict affects vaccine and drug supplies in multiple ways.", "Some logistical issues include the targeting of NGOs and other suppliers due to their perceived government and UN ties, disruption of supply routes by armed forces, raids and attacks, and problems transporting supplies due to terrain."]
["A third likely reason for the failing of so many rural insurance schemes is the lack of government support that would help such a setup to thrive.", "Generally, donor-funded schemes will need to become independent at some point after insurance scheme has been established and the initial donor has pulled out.", "Due to the various high costs and issues described above, many schemes will likely find themselves unable to pay for all utilized services at some point after this.", "If the government has also been a stakeholder in the development process, they might be able to subsidize the insurance scheme or provide some funding to keep the organization running.", "If not, in many cases, the insurance scheme may find itself unable to continue running."]
["What is so intriguing about is the fact that during a ten year conflict within the country from 1996-2006, there  was  improvement in 16 of 19 Millennium Development Goals at the same time.", "This goes against traditional thinking, that during conflict health indicators will regress.", "Are there lessons that can be taken away for future conflict interventions?"]
["Before discussing the relationship between equity and efficiency, it is important to discern between the three types of efficiency:"]
["While conflict often causes NGOs and bilateral agencies to intervene, this adds yet another level of coordination to the puzzle.", "In this paper, various armed conflicts around the world will be discussed, highlighting particular health system needs and basic health-systems failings.", "In addition, some common considerations, such as the common use of mobile health clinics and the provision of mental health care, are also discussed.", "Finally, the special case of Nepal deserves attention."]
["These concepts can seem at times to be in direct opposition to the idea of equity.", "A good example of this tension between equity and efficiency can be seen in Oregon in the 1990s when their Medicaid system decided to prioritize health interventions based on their DALYs and what services were most cost efficient.", "This ground-breaking system was based on the idea of allocative efficiency.", "It wasn't long until a child diagnosed with leukemia was denied care because the services weren't viewed as cost-effective in Medicaid's new system.", "The uproar over denial of care for cancer treatments eventually led to Oregon abandoning the system altogether."]
