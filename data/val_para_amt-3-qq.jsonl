["Though the European population in Angola was rising it wasn't until after World War II that large scale white immigration began.", "The war had been a successful period for neutral Portugal, and the economy of Angola grew as demand for tropical commodities increased, and Portuguese exploitation of African labor was expanded.", "Under the system of forced labor, African groups were moved around the country, causing conflicts between the displaced tribes which would continue into the modern era.", "Unlike industrial France and Britain, Portugal was relatively poor and undeveloped and thus more dependent on its overseas possessions for its economic well-being."]
["The discovery of oil in the exclave of Cabinda in the 1960s and the continued development of coffee, cotton, and diamonds as viable exports, led to Angola having one of the most robust and diversified economies of Africa in this time.", "Maintenance of these commercial activities was however highly dependent on European technicians and specialists and was almost completely controlled by these groups, preventing the majority of the population, who were largely engaged in subsistence farming or as laborers on commercial farms, from reaping the benefits of this wealth."]
["There is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically.", "Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule.", "The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies.", "Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education.", "These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies.", "The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa.", "Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them.", "According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony's educational system."]
["In 1974 a left-leaning military coup overthrew the government of Marcello Caetano, ending the authoritarian Estado Novo (New State) that had ruled Portugal since 1932.", "The unpopular colonial wars played a large role in the coup, and the new government pledged to withdraw Portuguese troops from the colonies and grant them independence.", "In Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, which had unified nationalist movements, this process was relatively straightforward, with the Portuguese colonial authorities handing power over to FRELIMO and PAIGC, respectively.", "The fragmented state of nationalism in Angola complicated the situation and meant that a framework for regime change had to be created."]
["In the north the FNLA began a major offensive, their ranks bolstered by hired western mercenaries and Zairian soldiers and artillery.", "The CIA and China also provided the FNLA with generous military aid in the form of money and arms.", "The MPLA continued to receive arms shipments from the Soviet Union and in May recruited the fiercely anti-Mobutu Katangese rebels who had previously served the Portuguese as counterinsurgency troops.", "The FNLA offensive reached the outskirts of Luanda, but was stopped by the arrival of 1,500 Cuban soldiers and additional Soviet weapons in August.", "The poorly equipped FNLA guerillas, even with Zairian and foreign mercenary support were no match for the highly trained Cuban soldiers that supported the MPLA and were soon routed and forced to retreat into their strongholds in the north and back into Zaire."]
["On the onset of the war, two main groups challenged the Portuguese, the MPLA and the FNLA (previously UPA).", "Established in Luanda, the MPLA derived much of its support from Mbundus in the cities and along the coast.", "Marxist-leaning mesticos and assimilados made up most of the group's leadership and formed ties with the Soviet Union and other communist countries.", "Agostihno Neto, an assimilado doctor educated in Lisbon, was the early leader of the MPLA and would later become the first president of independent Angola.", "The FNLA, led by Holden Roberto, was based in neighboring Congo (Leopoldville) and largely a regional and ethnic group representing the interests of the Bakongo people of northern Angola.", "The United States and later China provided monetary and material support to the FNLA and under the regime of Joseph Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko), Zaire would send its own troops into Angola to bolster the FNLA's ranks."]
["Before the arrival of the Portuguese in the late fifteenth century, southwest Africa was occupied by several Bantu-speaking kingdoms that had displaced previous Pygmy and Khoisan peoples.", "These states included the large Kongo kingdom situated along the Congo River and the Kimbundu-speaking Kingdom of Ngola to its south, which gave rise to the Portuguese name for the colony."]
["Initial relations between Portugal and Kongo were respectful, with both sides exchanging ambassadors and gifts.", "Within twenty years members of the Kongo royal family, including the king, had adopted Catholicism and encouraged Portuguese missionaries to spread the faith among the people."]
["Just as most other European countries were beginning to exit or disengage from their African colonies, Portugal dug in, strengthening its connections with and increasing its presence on the continent.", "Angola was used as a repository for Portugal's underemployed and impoverished excess population, and settlers continued to flock to urban areas.", "With the white population increasing from 44,000 in 1940 to 325,000 in 1974, Europeans soon took over not only upper and mid-level positions, but also most low-wage jobs in the city, displacing most of the urban African population."]
["The Ovaherero who survived the war were largely rounded up and put in concentration camps, where they went through a process of cultural assimilation to fulfill their roles as a proletariat of labor to support the white population.", "Though education was disrupted during the war, enrollment surpassed prewar levels by 1905.", "Many natives sought humanitarian assistance from missionaries and converted to Christianity in this period.", "Missionary societies filled the gap left by the destruction of the native tribal structure.", "A much smaller and more concentrated population was easier for them to manage and influence than the large nomadic groups present before the war.", "These final steps of settler domination in the colony led to the full development of the educational system as earlier described, one in which Africans were trained to be a proletariat occupying only the lowest rungs of the labor market and for the benefit of the settler population."]
["Initially the Germans were unable to effectively resist the Ovaherero.", "Against the 8,000 Ovaherero fighting-men, 6,000 of whom were equipped with firearms, the Germans could only present a 750-man garrison.", "This proved to be a major embarrassment for the German colonial administration.", "Soon more soldiers were called in from Germany and Lothar von Trotha replaced Leutwein as commander of the military.", "Von Trotha was an experienced general with a reputation for brutal repression of native uprisings in East Africa and China.", "Perhaps fearing that Von Trotha would turn on them after defeating the Ovaherero, the Witbooi and other Nama groups joined the rebellion.", "This led to the end of Leutwein's native policy and his eventual replacement as Landeshauptmann in 1905."]
["After pacifying the urban podar popular movements, which had been causing internal conflict within the organization, the MPLA focused on neutralizing the FNLA and UNITA threats.", "In contrast with that of the USSR and Cuba, the American and South African presence in Angola was more clandestine and less popular.", "Cuba, another poor country with a colonial heritage, was seen as extending Third World solidarity to the Angolans and defending them from a racist South Africa.", "Both South Africa and the US also had strong ties with the Portuguese, and this association with imperialism made them unpopular with many groups in Angola.", "Once it became better known that the US was providing arms to the FNLA and that UNITA's military successes in the south were largely due to the SADF, international and domestic opinion increasingly sided with the MPLA, and South Africa was soon pressured to leave Angola.", "War-weary from Vietnam and wary of new Third World conflicts, a new Democratic Congress in Washington moved to ban military aid to the FNLA."]
