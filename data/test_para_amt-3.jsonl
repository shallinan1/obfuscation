["This support often is vertical and often doesn't take the full IDP situation into account.", "In fact, over 50% of African countries did not mention their IDPs in their HIV National Strategic Plans and Global Fund proposals  indicating a lack of awareness of the need to build capacity for this portion of the population within their borders.", "This goes largely back to the issue of location.", "IDPs are often in inaccessible areas where governments don't have health programs and don't have the funds to initiate them.", "In addition, countries have a basic responsibility to care for refugees, based on the 1951 refugee convention but no such mandate exists for IDPs.", "As an anecdotal example, the WHO cited one of the failings with the Kenya emergency response in 2007 to be that the emergency response plan was only 28% funded."]
["In response to some of these issues, the World Bank has issued grants for a number of projects that include micro-financing for healthcare services in IDP situations.", "Generally these grants pay to rehabilitate the physical structures, often in conjunction with schools and other buildings that offer similar services.", "However, these sorts of grants generally are post-conflict.", "Effective financing mechanisms during conflict to ensure access for the most vulnerable is largely done through grants and donations to NGOs or UN services where the country's health infrastructure is insufficient."]
["In many conflict zones, NGOs \"pick up the slack\" in providing healthcare services to citizens and IDPs.", "This is reliant on government cooperation and funding, whether via grants or private funding.", "In these frequent situations, coordination between agencies is of the utmost importance, as is earning the trust and commitment of country leadership.", "When collaboration with the government does not exist, NGOs can find it impossible to work.", "In March 2009, in response to President Omar Al-Bashir's indictment by the International Criminal Court, 13 major aid organizations were kicked out of the country, including Medecines Sans Frontiers, OXFAM, CARE, Save The Children, and the IRC.", "This expulsion left 1.5 million people without access to healthcare, according to the UN.", "Most of these organizations were never allowed back into the Sudan, leaving much smaller NGOs to take over programming for health and education services, which they were not equipped for.", "Similarly, in 2009 Ethiopia suspended the operations of around 40 NGOs, (mostly smaller organizations) for operations \"outside of their mandate\".", "While these sorts of situations occur infrequently, it does point to one of the real issues with the reliance on NGOs in conflict situations.", "If the government does not support their mission, they can be kicked out, leaving vulnerable populations without access to basic health care."]
["One area that is of particular concern is that of providing reproductive health in IDP and refugee situations.", "Due to the ever-changing US government stance on the \"Mexico City Policy,\" also known as the \"Global Gag Rule,\"  which is the refusal to fund organizations involved in any sort of abortion programming, reproductive health can be a difficult area for many NGOs reliant on USAID funding to work in."]
["In addition, According to N Hakamies, \"Although material and human resources are significant constraints on agencies, the main challenge is to tackle ideological, managerial and policy barriers, and those related to donor influence.\"", "Finding funding for family planning services continues to prove difficult for NGOs, and as a result they often do not exist or cannot meet the need levels of their constituencies."]
["Reproductive Health funding problems underscore a larger issue with a reliance on NGO services, as can often be seen in IDP situations.", "The ability to provide services is often reliant on funding from outside sources and its continuation is based not on the needs of those being served, but on what they can find funding to provide.", "Often an organization's decision to cease operations in a country has more to do with a lack of financial support than the successful completion of their programming."]
["There are certainly other issues with over reliance on NGO services, such as the fact that their services often don't solve the underlying infrastructure issues that will reemerge once the NGO presence is reduced.", "Many NGOs do not remain in-country for the post-conflict period.", "In effect, services are provided and once the initial emergency is over, the NGOs are gone and those still displaced must find a health provider somewhere else.", "This affects a country's capacity to rebuild post-conflict as well as their ability to provide services while the rebuilding effort is underway."]
["Another issue is the added levels of coordination that occur when working with multiple aid groups to ensure healthcare service coverage.", "NGO involvement in IDP aid is a fact of life, however.", "The critical point is that the Ministry of Health must coordinate among those organizations."]
["Much of the focus on healthcare provision during emergency and conflict situations revolves around the use of Mobile Health Units (MHUs).", "Mobile Health Units are, at their most basic, mobile service units that usually provide specific forms of both preventative and curative care.", "They are generally expensive, however, and the fact that they only provide services intermittently tends to affect when they are appropriate for use.", "According to Stephane du Mortier and Rudi Coninx, \"In situations of armed conflict, the range of PHC services that can be provided is severely restricted.", "This means that, in any given situation, it is essential to select the priority services among the spectrum of PHC services\".", "MHUs are limited in the number of services they can provide and the frequency at which they are available to any one community.", "These considerations must be kept in mind when formulating a plan as to how to use MHUs in any conflict or emergency setting."]
["Du Mortier and Coninx describe their use of MHUs with the International Committee of the Red Cross during the conflict in Columbia in 2005.", "In this case, the rebel forces refused to allow access to the Ministry of Health in the country to citizens in areas they held."]
["In addition, the only aid group they allowed to enter the region was the ICRC.", "For these reasons, it was clear that they needed the mobility the MHUs afforded them to ensure basic services were offered to as many citizens in the occupied areas as possible."]
["The point above is reiterated multiple times in Du Mortier and Coninx's article: the reason why MHUs were deemed acceptable in this case is because they were used as the only option.", "Du Mortier and Coninx stress in their document that MHUs should not be used to substitute Ministry of Health programming, but to supplement those services only in exceptional situations where access is restricted, as a last resort, if you will.", "They identify very specific targets that MHUs can be used to accomplish."]
["Substitution: As  described in the example above, where federal health programming is unable to reach citizens and IDPs, MHUs can be viewed as a temporary stopgap measure.", "In this case, the organization is acting as a replacement of services for leaders."]
["Support: In these cases, MHUs are used as a supplemental clinic to help officials meet their goals.", "This generally entails the establishment of common objectives between the government and the NGO which can realistically be supplemented in part by the use of MHUs."]
["Mobilization: In these cases, services are provided without the direct input of government officials.", "Support is developed among third parties that can exert pressure on government officials to take over and provide services."]
["It is important to note that regardless of the underlying targets, MHUs must not be viewed as permanent solutions, due to the limitations in numbers of services provided and high operating costs.", "In other words, MHUs are not viable stand-alone units that should be viewed as a part of the country's health infrastructure.", "MHUS are specifically to be used when there is no other option, and retired once the situation has stabilized."]
["There are many other considerations which are important to be aware of when deciding how and when to use MHUs.", "Du Mortier and Coninx highlight a few of these."]
["MHUs are often more successful for vertical programming.", "More specifically, MHUs are extremely good at screening and vaccinating for serious conditions that are slow to develop.", "Treatment for patients in the acute stage is not a recommended primary strategy for MHUs, largely due to the fact that they are only intermittently available for any population to access.", "Obviously, MHUs will deal with acute illnesses in many cases, but this is not their strength and should not be viewed as a primary acute care tool in the planning stage.", "This focus on preventative care is an important takeaway, and its usefulness in preventing communicable disease through screenings and vaccinations is a clear asset of this model.", "To this point, Du Mortier and Coninx make the following caveat:"]
["As indicated by the mention of triage above, staff in MHUs must be highly trained.", "In addition, access to a nearby clinic for referral is critical."]
["As stated by Du Mortier and Coninx:"]
["Du Mortier and Coninx go on to say that in their experience, patients will likely refuse transport \tto a clinic due to fears about where they are going and their ability to return to their families, \tbut the option to receive further treatment is important for the clinic to be viewed as a legitimate \thealthcare option."]
["Du Mortier and Coninx are also very careful to state that MHUs should not be viewed as an evaluation tool.", "MHUs do not provide assessments as to the state of health in an area, but are a treatment intervention ONLY."]
["As evidenced by Mortier and Coninx, MHUs are useful tools for providing some basic preventative and (barring any other options) acute health care when access is otherwise unavailable.", "It is important to reiterate that MHUs should be viewed as a last resort in providing medical services during conflict, not as a first option, which may often be the case when planning for interventions in conflict situations, due to their perceived flexibility."]
["The importance of providing mental health care, and screening for IDPs suffering from emotional issues is important for many reasons, one of which is the high rate of prevalence.", "In one study on survivors of the Kosovo conflict, it was found that of participants in one study:"]
["While it may seem obvious, survivors of conflict situations often have very specific mental health needs.", "Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) has integrated mental healthcare into their emergency response module.", "Community level workers are \"trained to identify and refer cases of mental disorders and epilepsy to the MSF mobile health clinics where the mental health team provided proper diagnosis and treatment.\".", "In Mueller's study, referrals to MSF in the Mindanao region of the Philippines were tracked, with 96% of those treated for emotional distress reporting a traumatic event, ( 54% home evacuation, 26% conflict, 5% destruction of property).", "The patients were tracked throughout brief psychotherapy sessions, and the results showed a marked improvement (via their scores on a self-reporting questionnaire)."]
["What are the implications of this study?", "Not only is the provision of mental healthcare during conflict situations feasible, but it is proven to be effective.", "The WHO has recommended incorporating mental health as one of the screening services offered by MHU, with referrals to trained mental health professionals as seen fit.", "It seems that adding mental health screening to MHU tasks has been shown in programming to be an effective tool for the future.", "Clearly, immediate conflict response focuses on morbidity and mortality, and rightly so.", "The international community, however, has correctly identified mental health as an important and under-appreciated aspect of conflict response and is taking steps to ensure those aspects are addressed moving forward."]
["In light of the many issues that make health service provision so difficult in IDP settings, it is useful to identify successes amid the confusion.", "In Understanding effects of armed conflict on health outcomes: the case of Nepal, Bhimsen Devkota and Edward R van Teijlingen find one such case."]
["Nepal was embroiled in a bloody civil war from 1996 until 2006.", "Surprisingly, however, they are still on track to meet 16 of the 19 Millennium Development Goals by 2015.", "While they are unlikely to meet the reproductive health targets, some of the goals Nepal is on track to meet include under-five and maternal mortality targets and disease-specific goals (halting the spread of HIV and malaria).", "The question is, how was Nepal able to meet these targets even when dealing with civil conflict and internally displaced people?"]
["Devotka and van Teijlingen identify multiple reasons why Nepal was successful even during such trying times.", "Some of the relevant items with regard to maintaining and strengthening health systems include:"]
["Neither side purposely disrupted health systems during the conflict.", "Though the conflict led to a decrease in service utilization, due to access problems, the rebels overall looked favorably on health services and made no efforts to deny access to citizens during the fighting."]
["The rebels made an effort to ensure health clinics in their area were still sufficiently staffed and supplied.", "Most clinics in rebel-held areas were sufficiently staffed and had supplies.", "While many of the clinics were operated without trained health professionals, they still received regular training and supplies."]
["Key actors increased coordination in response to the conflict, while maintaining a low profile.", "Regular meetings continued between the Ministry of Health (MOH) and community officials.", "In addition, the international organizations that responded by providing services kept a low profile.", "The one issue identified here, however, is the lack of clarity coming from the country level to all actors.", "While provisions were made for free care to poor citizens, criteria as to who qualified was not laid out to clinics.", "Similarly, communication between the MOH and international organizations was not identified as a strength of the program."]
["Public health and more traditional service providers also increased their efforts during the conflict.", "In addition, community clinics were handed over to the communities to manage, as the federal government did not have adequate resources to manage them during the conflict.", "Programming for the elderly and indigent was increased, and many traditional female \"attendants\" saw their role increased."]
["GDP in the country continued to rise during the extended conflict, and infrastructure improvements likely also contributed.", "These factors likely helped the country stay on track for the MDGs.", "The infrastructure improvements (roads and electricity) likely improved access for many citizens."]
["There are clear lessons for developing a health systems strengthening approach in other conflict situations here.", "Namely, commitment from both sides of the conflict to not disrupting the health provision infrastructure in the country is key.", "Ensuring clinics still run and funds are in place can help to minimize the effects of access and migration.", "In addition, the government must be able to hand off some of the management to provincial or community levels, especially in rebel-held zones where they have limited access."]
["So what are the takeaways from the Nepal case study?"]
["Was this situation an aberration, or can health status continue to improve event during armed conflict within a country?", "Devkota and Teijlingen think that the lessons learned by analyzing Nepal's approach towards health systems during civil war can indeed be applied elsewhere, and for good reason.", "At the end of the day, the primary takeaway message is that of coordination, a common theme even in the most stable of countries when discussing health systems.", "Coordination among the Ministry of Health and community offices, passing off duties when appropriate.", "Coordination between the Ministry of Health and international agents, such as the UN or NGOs.", "However, the conflict in Nepal had its own set of rules that likely don't exist in other areas."]
["In Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, NGO workers are regularly held hostage or killed due to their perceived western ties.", "In many conflicts aid organizations are often viewed as a target.", "In Nepal, the NGOs tended to keep a low profile which might have helped in this case.", "Of course, the bigger issue is involvement by both sides of the conflict.", "The idea that both sides will choose not to interfere with healthcare provision is simply unrealistic in many areas of the world.", "While utilizing the existing healthcare infrastructure as Nepal was able to do would be ideal, in genocides, such as in Rwanda or the Sudan, expecting both sides of the conflict to make efforts not to impede healthcare access is unrealistic."]
["In addition, Nepal's situation was unlike many countries dealing with internal conflict and IDPs.", "The effect of the continued growth of the national GDP cannot be understated, as the relationship between increased GDP and increased health indicators (such as the MDGs Nepal is on track to meet) is quite close.", "While internal conflict  would certainly mitigate some of the expected improvements due to GDP, those increases, as well as the infrastructure investments, likely played an important role in helping health status continue to improve through the ten year war."]
["There are some takeaways from Nepal and the other literature reviewed that can be applied to  all conflict situations, however.", "Firstly, increasing preventative care is of clear importance, as was also seen in the discussion of using MHUs in IDP situations.", "Vaccinations and screenings can do much to stop the spread of infectious diseases before a full-fledged outbreak of malaria occurs.", "In addition to preparation and disease monitoring, flexibility in these sorts of volatile, unpredictable situations is a clear priority."]
["The sorts of special considerations in Afghanistan and the Sudan should not be viewed as insurmountable obstacles.", "In an ideal world (more Nepal than some of the other cases) conflict would not affect citizens' access to healthcare and qualified health workers.", "However, as seen, there are real consequences that can be expected when internal conflict erupts (geographic and financial barriers and the brain drain).", "The international community has certainly worked hard at establishing frameworks for working in these sorts of situations, but there is still work to be done in developing plans to mitigate the long-term effects of some of these issues."]
["In Angola however, black Africans never made up less than 95% of the population, so the demographic situation there (and in the other Portuguese colonies) was never the same as it was in Brazil.", "Furthermore, the claim that racial mixing equates to racial egalitarianism is problematic, as there are significant racial inequities in Brazil and other countries with large mestico populations.", "The fact that the Portuguese were leaders in international trade of African slaves for nearly 400 years also challenges the theory.", "Despite its ostensibly obvious contradictions, lusotropicalism was widely accepted among the people of Portugal until the mid-1970s, and was used by the government to justify its continued involvement in Africa during a period when most European powers were leaving or had already left the continent.", "These colonial policies of the twentieth century instigated the forty years of conflict in Angola.", "However, a long history of violence and exploitation created the context for these struggles, starting with the Atlantic slave trade in the late fifteenth century."]
["After Vasco de Gama secured a passage to India at the turn of the sixteenth century, Portugal lost interest in Kongo and other African kingdoms as major trading partners, and began to view them primarily as sources of slaves.", "The slave trade came to dominate Portuguese-African relations and nearly all economic activity in Angola.", "As a highly lucrative business, it was often the primary occupation of most Portuguese in the area, including members of the colonial administration, with the governor essentially the largest slave-dealer.", "The Portuguese were leaders in the Atlantic slave trade, supplying not only their own plantation-dependent colonies with labor, but also those of France, Britain, and Spain.", "According to some estimates, as many as 8 million slaves were taken from Angola, a figure higher than the total population of the country upon independence in 1975.", "The slave trade caused major disturbances in the interior, with the associated violence and depopulation ultimately leading to the demise of the Kongo and other indigenous states."]
["The abolition of the international slave trade in the 1830s and of slavery throughout the Portuguese empire in the 1870s did not mark the end of forced African labor in Angola.", "Domestic slavery, particularly among the Kongo chiefs and highland kings of the interior was still widespread and slaves continued to be exported to Indian Ocean markets further east.", "Forced labor continued in a legal form under the new system of forced labor outlined in the 1878 Regulamento para os contratos de servicais e colonos nas provincias de Africa (Regulation for contracts of servants and colonists in the provinces of Africa).", "This document essentially made former slaves into \"servants\" or servicais, who had to be \"contracted\" into labor.", "The Regulamento also stipulated that any Angolans who were not fully employed were considered \"vagrants\" and could be legally forced into five-year contracts.", "While slaves were no longer exportable commodities on the same scale they were before the abolition of the slave trade, slavery persisted in much the same way it had in the past centuries, despite the change in nomenclature."]
["According to a British diplomat serving in Angola in 1902, \"nobody regarded the contract laborers as anything other than slaves.\""]
["Claims of racial tolerance aside, the Portuguese set up social, political, and economic hierarchies based on race throughout their reign over Angola.", "These distinctions and inequalities, as well as internal displacements of African tribes, created significant tensions between members of different ethnic and racial groups which would come to shape the formation of nationalist movements and the course of the post-colonial civil wars."]
["For the first few hundred years of Portuguese rule, the European population in Angola was minimal and largely limited to the coast.", "Though several attempts were made to found agricultural outposts with white settlers in the interior, these were largely failures.", "The oppressive tropical climate and hostile African neighbors made life difficult for settlers, many of whom lacked agricultural experience or expertise.", "However, at the root of the early failures of white settlement lied the Portuguese system of penal colonization.", "As with overseas colonization in general, the Portuguese were the first to begin and the last to stop the practice of using convicts as settlers in their colonies.", "The difficult nature of life in Africa made it difficult to find voluntary immigrants, so convicts, called degradados, were seen as an effective subsitute, as well as a solution to the problem of overcrowding in Portuguese prisons.", "Used as soldiers, settlers, and sailors, the degradados, together with exiled Jews, gypsies, and other \"undesirables,\" formed a large majority of the white population in Angola until the beginning of the twentieth century.", "The mortality rate among degredados was alarmingly high, and this further discouraged free immigration to Angola, creating a cycle of continued penal settlement.", "Because of their small numbers and unreliability, the degredados could not fulfill all the roles of colonial administration and commerce, a class of mesticos, also called the Afro-Portuguese, rose to take many these positions."]
["Originally descendant from the union of Portuguese soldiers and merchants with indigenous African women, the Afro-Portuguese eventually became their own distinct ethnic group and grew to wield significant economic, and later political, power.", "The influence of the mesticos began with the slave trade, in which they often served as middlemen between the Portuguese traders and indigenous African kingdoms, leading and accompanying trade caravans into the interior.", "Though the slave trade was initially associated with the areas in and around the Kongo kingdom and its capital of Sao Salvador, Afro-Portuguese traders began to penetrate the central highlands to the south to find new sources of slaves.", "Luanda and later Benguela were established as ports to facilitate direct the new trade with Brazil and the other colonies.", "The decline of the Kongo due to a series of wars with the Portuguese in the seventeenth century, together with the stronger and more direct connections with colonial traders enjoyed by the Afro-Portuguese led to the eclipse of Sao Salvador by Luanda as the center of the Angolan slave trade, and by extension, economic activity in the region."]
["This economic power soon became political, and by the nineteenth century the Afro-Portuguese dominated the areas of the central highlands closer to the coast, presiding over several semi-autonomous kingdoms (reinos) centered on the coastal ports of Luanda and Benguela.", "These reinos were under the technical sovereignty of the Portuguese crown but were in practice ruled by the leading mestico families.", "Seeing themselves as ethnically distinct from the indigenous Africans, the Afro-Portuguese were nonetheless visually indistinguishable from black Africans and often spoke Kimbundu as well as Portuguese.", "Still, the Afro-Portuguese \"seldom, if ever, identified with the Africans because for all practical purposes they were Portuguese in nearly every way except colour.\""]
["Later in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, some of the old Afro-Portuguese families began to merge with the other Kimbundu-speaking peoples of coastal and central Angola to form the modern Mbundu ethnic identity.", "The history of Afro-Portuguese dominance and compliance with the Portuguese colonial authorities created rifts between the coastal and inland peoples, which would continue to manifest themselves in the post-colonial conflicts, as the coastal and Mbundu-dominated MPLA struggled to win support among the Ovimbundu people of the interior."]
["The relative dominance of the Afro-Portuguese began to be challenged in the late 1800s, as the Portuguese were increasingly pressured to \"modernize\" their colonies by their colonial neighbors, the British and Germans.", "To do this, the old system of indirect rule through mestico and African allies had to be replaced by direct Portuguese control and white settlement.", "Though European settlement continued at a relatively slow pace through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, restrictions were gradually made on which civil service and military positions Africans or mesticos could occupy.", "As the Afro-Portuguese were increasingly excluded from the higher levels of colonial administration, they had to compete with poor white immigrants for lower level jobs.", "Modern forms of transportation like the railroad and steamships began to dominate trade at the expense of the old mestico-controlled caravans, further undermining their economic activities.", "The Afro-Portuguese were also challenged by a growing population of urbanized and mostly missionary-educated Africans."]
["In an attempt to create a more defined social hierarchy, the Portuguese implemented as system of assimilation, drawing a distinction between indigena (indigenous) and assimilado (assimilated) populations.", "Members of the indigena group were given access to few political rights and restricted to only the lowest and most menial forms of employment.", "By contrast, assimilados, mainly urbanized, were granted some political rights and eventually Portuguese citizenship.", "Becoming an assmilado meant showing a certain degree of educational attainment and financial security, in addition to adopting the Portuguese language and culture.", "The criteria for entry into the assimilado class were regulated by the Portuguese colonial authorities."]
["Assimilados were further divided into two groups, \"assimilated objects\" and \"assimilated groups,\" with the former mostly made up of the established Afro-Portuguese families who worked in various levels of the colonial government and the latter of the growing class of missionary-educated Africans."]
["This new system created even more divisions in Angolan society by separating the population into groups, which actively competed with one another.", "The old Afro-Portuguese families, who often identified economically and culturally with the white settlers, saw their historical privileges taken away and became increasingly critical of the colonial government and at odds with white settlers.", "Mesticos also felt threatened by the newly educated class of Africans, who were seen as usurping their traditional roles in the colonial hierarchy.", "This split within the assimilado group carried on through the civil war, with the MPLA leadership coming mostly from the older established group, and the leaders of FNLA and UNITA from the newer group."]
["Besides the divisions among assimilados, there was also significant tension between assimilado and indigena populations.", "When they went through the process of assimilation, assimilados made a conscious decision to completely abandon their African heritage and adopt European culture.", "This process detached the assimilados from the largely rural, uneducated indigenas and often made it difficult for the two groups to see eye-to-eye and identify with one another.", "Though Africans continued to enter the assimilado class, the stringent restrictions on assimilation and the reluctance of many Africans to give up their African culture meant that less than 1% of Angola's population was ever formally assimilated."]
["In the post-WWII period white immigration to Angola reached new highs as industrialization brought about massive rural unemployment in Portugal.", "Immigration to Africa was seen as both a solution to Portugal's excess population problem and as a way to strengthen Portuguese control over its colonies.", "With the white population in Angola increasing from 44,000 in 1940 to 325,000 in 1974, Europeans soon took over not only upper and mid-level positions, but also most low-wage jobs in the city, displacing most of the urban African population.", "Having lost much of their status to poor white settlers, mestico and assimilado populations felt increasingly marginalized by the Portuguese, and members of these groups would form the leadership of most of the independence movements in the 1950s and 60s.", "In addition to the social-cultural hierarchy imposed by the Portuguese, ethnic divisions were also intensified by other colonial policies."]
["The effects of the plantation system in the early twentieth century also exacerbated tensions between African ethnic groups.", "In the northern part of the country, large numbers of peasants were displaced to make room for commercial coffee plantations.", "Many of these farmers, mostly Kikongo-speaking members of the Bakongo ethnic group, fled to neighboring Zaire, where they flourished as small-scale commercial coffee farmers.", "As successful small entrepreneurs, many of the Bakongo diaspora in Zaire would be wary of the socialist policies of the MPLA, and would instead choose to support the ostensibly more business-friendly FNLA, which was also led by Bakongo and based in Zaire.", "After living in francophone Zaire for several generations, most of the Bakongo refugees adopted French, further dividing them from the mostly Portuguese-speaking groups in Angola."]
["Further south in the central highlands, the primary commercial crop was cotton, and British and Portuguese cotton plantations displaced the native Ovimbundu.", "Unlike the Bakongo farmers of the north who largely stayed together and settled in Zaire, the Ovimbundu dispersed in all directions, some remained in the area to work the cotton fields, while others migrated north to work on the coffee plantations or south to less populated areas.", "The employment of Ovimbundu on land formerly occupied by Bakongo farmers created tensions between the two groups.", "Furthermore as they were largely employed in lowly paid plantation work, the Ovimbundu occupied the low end of the economic scale, being scorned by both the Bakongo and Mbundu as crude and subservient.", "The animosity displayed by the other ethnic groups toward the Ovimbundu caused many of them to reject the two dominant nationalist groups, the FNLA and MPLA, during the liberation war, in favor of UNITA, an explicitly Ovimbundu-based organization."]
["The continued fragmentation of its nationalist movements set Angola apart from other Portuguese colonies.", "In Mozambique Julius Nyerere united the various factions under the banner of FRELIMO, and Amilcar Cabral convinced the assimilados of Cape Verde and the peasants of Guinea-Bissau to unite as PAIGC.", "In both of these situations, the rebel groups fought successful united campaigns against the Portuguese and were on the verge of victory at the time of independence.", "By contrast, no single nationalist movement in Angola was able to unite the various rebel factions in the struggle against Portugal for independence, and the three major groups that came to dominate the fourteen-year liberation war often fought each other as much as the Portuguese."]
["The Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) was initially formed in the late 1950s by a young group of Angolans studying in Lisbon and Paris, including Lucio Lara, Agostinho Neto, Mario de Andrade, and Jose Eduardo dos Santos (Neto's successor and the current president of Angola).", "Counting urban mesticos and assimilados, in addition to some liberal whites among its ranks, the MPLA was explicitly inclusive and set out to unite Angolans of different ethnic, religious, and regional backgrounds into one independence movement.", "Many of the founders had been members of the Communist Party of Angola (PCA) and a Marxist class-based ideology was adopted by the movement, partially as a uniting force for a group without a strong ethnic or regional base.", "Despite this, the MPLA initially struggled to build popular support.", "Many Angolans were suspicious of the MPLA, which represented the old mestico and assimilado elite of the coastal cities and had a history of dominating the largely rural populations of the interior.", "Rival groups like the FNLA highlighted this distrust by publicly condemning the MPLA as out of touch with the peasants that made up 93% of the Angolan population.", "They further stated that an independent Angola under the MPLA would be dominated by urban mesticos and assimilados, effectively transferring power from one class of colonial masters to another."]
["Lacking strong domestic backing, the MPLA looked abroad for military and economic support.", "Its leftist revolutionary agenda naturally aligned the MPLA with communist nations and the Soviet Union and Cuba became the movement's strongest allies, with the Soviets providing material aid, money, and weapons and the Cubans eventually sending soldiers to assist with security and military campaigns.", "Other communist countries in Eastern Europe also supplied arms and military advisors, including the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)."]
["Support from other African countries was more limited.", "Neighboring Zaire and South Africa actively backed the FNLA and UNITA, both committing significant numbers of soldiers to fight the MPLA.", "Other African nations were less hostile; during the independence war the organization was based at different times in Congo-Brazzaville, Tanzania, and Zambia.", "Tanzania and Zambia also served as transit points for incoming Soviet arms shipments."]
["Though a relatively unified group during most of the civil war, divisions within the MPLA threatened its existence in its early years and into the 1970s.", "At the root of the inner factionalism was the disparate backgrounds of MPLA members, which included both educated mesticos and assimilados as well as uneducated peasants.", "Various groups formed factions that struggled for dominance within the movement.", "One major split was the Eastern Revolt led by Daniel Chipenda in the early-1970s, which set the guerillas doing most of the fighting against the political organization led by Agostihno Neto in Luanda.", "Chipenda eventually joined the FNLA and helped elicit the support of South Africa in the war against his old organization."]
["The Frente Nacional de Libertacao de Angola (National Front for the Liberation of Angola) grew out of the UPA (Union of Peoples of Angola, previously Union of Peoples of Northern Angola), a predominately Bakongo movement based in northern Angola and led by Holden Roberto.", "While the MPLA had its origins in Lisbon and Luanda, the UPA was founded in Leopoldville (modern Kinshasa) in neighboring Congo, also home to a large Bakongo population.", "In the late 1950s and 60s, Leopoldville was a center of nationalist activism, hosting a large refugee community from Angola and over fifty Angolan political organizations, mostly made up of Bakongos.", "Unlike the ideologically based MPLA, the UPA and other Bakongo nationalist movements appealed directly to the Bakongo ethnic group and the heritage of the old Kongo kingdom.", "Though Holden Roberto had ambitions of making the UPA/FNLA a nation-wide movement with broad-based support, it remained for most of its history an organization dominated by Bakongos, and was responsible for numerous acts of violence against mesticos, assimilados, whites, and non-Bakongo Africans, particularly the Ovimbundu who worked on the coffee plantations of the north."]
["Its reputation for violence and the lack of discipline among its ranks led many to distrust the FNLA, and greatly decreased its effectiveness.", "Infighting plagued the organization throughout its history as well.", "According to John Stockwell, chief of the CIA's Angola Task  Force in 1975, the FNLA \"had few educated men at the top--no intellectuals--and had spent much of its history in the cocktail parties of Kinshasa."]
["The FNLA soldiers [were] slathering animals.\""]
["Though consistently armed by the US and China and supported by troops and artillery from Mobutu's Zaire, the FNLA was not able to maintain military success against the Cuban-backed MPLA and ceased to be a major force in Angolan politics after 1976,"]
["The Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) was a latecomer in the independence struggle, formed in 1966 by Jonas Savimbi.", "A Swiss- and Portuguese-educated Angolan emigre of Ovimbundu descent, Savimbi was for a time a member on the FNLA but left the organization in 1964.", "The Mbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups dominated the MPLA and FNLA leadership, while the largest group, the Ovimbundu, had limited representation.", "Seeking to create a nationalist movement for his own people, Savimbi formed UNITA, basing his power among the Ovimbundu capital of Huambo."]
["UNITA received aid from the US and South Africa for most of its existence and espoused an anti-communist agenda, though Savimbi had himself been a Marxist at one time.", "After being defeated right after independence UNITA retreated deep into the Angolan bush and built up an army of several thousand men with fanatically loyal officers.", "Savimbi's charisma and previous training in China helped him build an effective fighting force that challenged the MPLA for over twenty-five years.", "However, the fact that UNITA was built around Savimbi meant that after his death the movement disintegrated."]
["Through the entire course of conflict in Angola from 1961 to 2002, foreign powers were involved in various degrees, from direct military assistance to monetary and diplomatic backing of one or more of the internal movements.", "Ranging from global superpowers like the United States and the Soviet Union to regional players like South Africa and Zaire, numerous countries entered the conflict and complicated the situation.", "American, Soviet, and Chinese involvement were rooted primarily in the existential Cold War struggle of ideologies and global geopolitics, with economic interests also playing a major role for the United States.", "Regional powers were influenced by the superpowers and motivated by a number of other factors as well.", "The changing nature of world politics would alter the course of the war and most of the major powers would withdraw from Angola in the late-1980s and early-1990s."]
["Chief among the regional powers involved in Angola were Zaire and South Africa.", "Both countries had strong motivations for their presence in Angola and importantly the means to affect the course of the war.", "The rise of Black Nationalism and the decolonization of many countries in the region posed a major threat to the survival of the apartheid regime of South Africa.", "Politically and economically based on a persistent system of racial oppression and exploitation, South Africa, as well as the other remaining settler colony, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), was under heavy international pressure to grant rights to its African majority and faced various boycotts and trade embargos as a result."]
["Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were seen as potential solutions to South Africa's economic and security problems, and South Africa had worked with the Portuguese colonial government in the past.", "With both territories possessing large settler populations, friendly post-colonial regimes could be set up with South African military intervention, turning the former Portuguese colonies into buffer states and important allies in a hostile neighborhood.", "Furthermore, Angola's developed infrastructure and rich resource wealth could help South Africa economically, as it felt increasingly isolated by the international community."]
["Having the largest and most powerful military of the region, South Africa had the means to accomplish its objectives.", "Military bases in South-West Africa (Namibia) served as a useful staging ground for intervention in Angola.", "In addition to its own motivations, South Africa was encouraged to intervene by the United States, who felt that they were needed to counter the Cuban and Soviet support of the MPLA.", "After invitations from both UNITA and the FNLA in the early days of the civil war, South Africa made its first incursion into Angola in June of 1975.", "This action would be the first of twelve invasions by the SADF, which would be vital for the survival of UNITA as a viable military force.", "The continued involvement of South Africa forced the MPLA to rely on Cuban and Soviet military support throughout the civil war.", "The transition to a post-apartheid government in the early-90s and the independence of Namibia meant that South Africa would no longer intervene militarily in Angola.", "UNITA would have to depend on its other regional ally, Zaire, for continued support against the MPLA."]
["Sharing a large border and deep cultural ties that went back to the Kongo kingdom, Zaire and Angola were strongly connected.", "Throughout the liberation war, Zaire served as a base of operations for the Bakongo-dominated FNLA and provided it significant military assistance.", "Besides the solidarity showed to their Bakongo kin, Mobutu's Zaire had other important reasons for fighting the MPLA.", "Some of these were ideological; Mobutu was a staunch Cold War ally of the US and was highly critical of communism.", "His experience with Soviet-supported Katangese rebels in the late 1960s helped establish these views and when this group began to fight on the side of the MPLA in 1975, it only increased the animosity between Mobutu and the MPLA.", "Other aspects of the MPLA and Mobutu's ideologies also clashed.", "While the MPLA espoused multi-racial and cosmopolitan views, Mobutu was a black nationalist with strong ideals of African authenticity.", "Starting in 1975, Zaire sent several battalions of regular soldiers as well as commando units into Angola, after unsupported FNLA guerillas proved ineffective.", "Even with significant weapons provided by the US and other Western nations, the Zairians were decisively defeated by the MPLA and their Cuban allies.", "In the disorganized retreat back into Zaire, the troops wrecked havoc on the countryside and abandoned large amounts of American weapons, exposing the US's somewhat clandestine support of the FNLA."]
["In the 1990s Zaire served as the main supporter of UNITA, as South African and American support for the organization dwindled.", "In 1997 a coup supported in part by the Angolan government overthrew Mobutu, and Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo.", "Without the aggressive Mobutu regime as a neighborhood, the situation in Angola stabilized and the MPLA was finally able to crack down on internal dissent without being troubled with foreign intervention, ending the civil war a few years later in 2002."]
["Like most other Third World conflicts of the twentieth century, the wars in Angola were heavily affected by the Cold War.", "In addition to the competition between the US and the USSR, several other factors motivated the involvement of international powers: the Sino-Soviet split, Third World solidarity against Western exploitation and imperialism, and in the case of the US, Angola's large oil reserves."]
["The USSR was involved with the MPLA from its foundation in the late-1950s.", "Starting in 1958, MPLA founding member Mario de Andrade would travel to Moscow on a regular basis for various conferences and meetings.", "During these visits the MPLA developed a relationship with the Soviets, securing funding and in 1961 the explicit support of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who stated that \"the patriots of Angola can be sure that the sympathies of the peoples of the great Soviet Union are fully on their side.\"", "Many MPLA leaders would go on to be educated in Moscow."]
["The USSR chose to support the MPLA over rival movements in Angola for a number of reasons.", "As a left-leaning Marxist movement that explicitly condemned the imperial powers, the MPLA followed the same basic ideological principles as the USSR.", "The UPA/FNLA was more ambiguous on this issue, receiving support from the US and sometimes practicing anti-communist rhetoric.", "The MPLA was also not as focused on regional or ethnic issues, as the predominately Bakongo UPA based in northern Angola was.", "The USSR also practiced the policy of recognizing and supporting only one rebel movement within a conflict, a policy not shared by all of its peers."]
["Early Soviet support of the MPLA included food and clothing as well as weapons and increased progressively during the course of the war from goods valued at $25,000 in 1961 to $220,000 in 1973.", "Large scale Soviet assistance did not come until 1975 though.", "In this year another foreign power would join the equation, with Cuba's shipment of two shiploads of T-55 tanks and 500 military advisories.", "Though the Cubans and Soviets would work together closely in Angola, early actions were not coordinated as is widely assumed.", "Cuba was not simply a Soviet proxy but rather had its own agenda for being in Angola.", "As a Third World country with a colonial past and communist government, Cuba wanted to sustain the global conflict against the West and imperialism through spreading Marxist-Leninist revolution."]
["Increasing antagonism with the US meant that Cuba was also looking to foil American plans abroad, and the Angolan crisis was a perfect opportunity for Cuba to use its strong military to embarrass the US.", "Fidel Castro initially acted unilaterally and without notifying the Soviets on his intentions in Angola.", "However, Cuban and Soviet collaboration soon led to highly effective assistance to the MPLA, with the Cubans provided tens of thousands of well-trained soldiers and the Soviets technical expertise and military equipment, particularly in the field of heavy artillery and tanks, which were previously absent in the Angolan theater.", "By the 1980s, a Soviet investment of $5 billion in military hardware helped lead the MPLA to victory in the war.", "Weapons provided included \"T-34 and T-54 tanks, 100mm guns, 120mm multiple rocket launchers, amphibious vehicles, helicopters equipped with 20mm cannon and air-to-ground rockets\" as well as MIG-17 and MIG-21 fighter jets.", "Soviet and Cuban presence continued until the late 80s when global political changes and the end of the Cold War took away many of the incentives of remaining in Angola.", "Without Cuban and Soviet backing, the MPLA would have never been able to defeat its opponents, who also had the support of foreign superpowers."]
["The initial reasons for United States intervention in Angola were primarily economic.", "American oil companies were well established there since the discovery of oil in the 1950s, and in order to protect these interests, the US supported the Portuguese during the liberation war.", "By the time the Portugal was preparing to leave the continent in 1974, the threat of communist takeover by the MPLA with Cuban and Soviet support influenced the US to fund alternative groups to prevent a communist victory.", "A Soviet friendly nation in southern Africa might tip the balance of power in favor of the communists and set off more leftist revolutions in the region.", "Since 1961, the US had been supporting Holden Roberto with a modest stipend of $10,000 a year.", "In the light of the new situation, this sum was increased to $300,000 in 1975, and throughout that year $35 million was spent on arming the FNLA through airbases in friendly Zaire.", "US involvement was relatively clandestine at this stage, mostly involving the CIA and indirect aid to the FNLA through Zaire.", "An American population weary from Vietnam was not willing to enter another bloody Third World conflict so far from home."]
["Despite the official backing of the FNLA, many within the US establishment did not agree with the decision to support the FNLA.", "Two important US officials in Luanda, Robert W. Hultslander, the CIA station chief, and Tom Killoran, the American Consul General, agreed that the MPLA were the most qualified of the groups to govern and sought peaceful relations with Washington.", "Hultslander further stated that its leaders \"were more effective, better educated, better trained, and better motivated\"; by contrast the FNLA \"was led by corrupt, unprincipled men who represented the very worst of radical black African racism.\""]
["The commitment to fighting communism and the US's previous relationship with Holden Roberto trumped the opinions of the dissenters and the US continued to support the FNLA."]
["US weapons, foreign mercenaries, and Zairian and South African forces were unable to defeat the MPLA with their Cuban and Soviet allies and American involvement declined during the following years under the Carter administration.", "The 1980 election of Ronald Reagan brought the US back into the fold of the Angolan Civil War, with continued support of UNITA."]
["Though UNITA achieved some military victories with the help of the SADF, particularly at Cuito-Cuanavale in 1988 where they beat off a large attack by MPLA and Cuban forces, it became increasingly clear that neither side would gain an upper hand and that most of the military successes on both sides were due to the Cuban and South African forces.", "As both Cuba and South Africa agreed to leave Angola where they were both essentially fighting another country's war for them, US support for UNITA also decreased and under the Bush and Clinton administrations closer ties were made with the MPLA and it was recognized diplomatically as the legitimate government of Angola.", "With the Cold War over and its oil interests safe, the US had little reason to be actively supporting rebel movements in Angola."]
["China was the third superpower to project its power in Angola.", "Chinese involvement was mostly limited to the first two decades of war and was rooted in its opposition to Soviet expansion coming out of the Sino-Soviet split.", "This anti-Sovietism held together the curious alliance of two African nationalist groups (the FNLA and UNITA), Zaire, apartheid South Africa, communist China, and the United States.", "Starting with the training of UNITA operatives in Beijing during the late-1960s, Chinese support eventually rested primarily on the FNLA.", "After the events of 1974-1976, China was discouraged by the course of the war and withdrew its military advisors and materiel aid."]
["The Angolan War of Independence together with the Angolan Civil War cost hundreds of thousands of Angolans their lives, and occupied the country for over forty years.", "The effects of the conflict are still felt today as thousands of landmines make farming in many areas very dangerous and tensions between different ethnic and political groups still exist, though not on the scale it previously did."]
["The underlying causes of the long conflict are many and complicated, having their roots in nearly five centuries of disruptive Portuguese rule in which millions of Angolans were enslaved or forced into labor and the population was divided into a racial hierarchy that led to distrust and resentment between groups."]
["Constant internal factionalism and massive foreign intervention prolonged and intensified the conflict, leading to one of the most devastating wars on the African continent.", "The past eight years have been relatively peaceful for Angola and the economy has been growing at a rapid rate, though much of this is due to oil revenues and expansion of the oil industry.", "A fledging democracy is forming."]
