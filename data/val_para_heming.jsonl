["\"Try one of these T-bones with hashed-brown potatoes,\" the drummer suggested.", "\"They got a nice T-bone here.\""]
["\"Here's your crackers and milk, Diana,\" Mandy said, placing them on the counter.", "\"Do you want a T-bone, sir?\""]
["\"Wait till you see if he lays eggs,\" the drummer suggested.", "Scripps looked into the drummer's eyes.", "The fellow had voiced his own unspoken thought."]

["\"The O. M.,\" the elderly Mrs. Scripps explained."]
["Scripps wondered.", "Perhaps the bird was a parrot.", "A parrot strayed from some comfortable home with some old maid.", "The untilled soil of some New England spinster."]

["\"You know a thing or two, drummer,\" he said."]
["\"Perhaps you have eaten enough of the beans, dear Scripps,\" the elderly waitress, now his wife, said.", "The drummer looked up from his paper.", "Scripps noticed it was the Detroit News.", "There was a fine paper."]
["\"Yes, dear,\" Scripps agreed.", "He felt vaguely mistrustful of himself.", "Something, somewhere was stirring inside of him.", "He looked at the waitress called Mandy, standing robust and vigorously lovely in her newly starched white apron.", "He watched her hands, healthy, calm, capable hands, doing the duties of waitresshood."]
["\"Really, dear Mandy,\" Mrs. Scripps said, \"you've told that story rather often.\""]
["After eating his beans the bird had fallen asleep.", "He was sleeping on one leg, the other tucked up into his feathers."]
["Ah, these big beanery owners were wise fellows.", "They knew how to get the customers.", "No ads in The Saturday Evening Post for them.", "The Best by Test.", "That was the stuff.", "He went in."]
["\"'I stopped at your shop with my mother,' I said to the coiffeur, 'and my mother bought a bottle of aromatic salts.'"]
["\"At least, General Sherman,\" Scripps's mother said triumphantly, \"that column of smoke will warn the other loyal daughters of the Confederacy that you are coming.\""]
["\"They're mighty fine beans, too,\" Scripps agreed.", "Under the influence of the beans his head was clearing.", "What was this rot he had been talking about that man Henry Mencken?", "Was Mencken really after him?", "It wasn't a pretty prospect to face.", "He had four hundred and fifty dollars in his pocket.", "When that was gone he could always put an end to things.", "If they pressed him too far they would get a big surprise.", "He wasn't the man to be taken alive.", "Just let them try it."]

["The wicket came up, and a large plate of beans and a small plate of beans, both steaming, appeared."]
["He motioned to one of his soldiers, who ran forward and threw a bucket of kerosene on the flames.", "The flames rose and a great column of smoke went up in the still evening air."]

["\"Once again on the loud ones,\" the waitress called into the wicket.", "\"Lay off the bird.\""]
["\"Not if you'd rather not,\" Scripps said.", "\"By the way, could I have another order of beans?\""]
["\"Please go on with your story,\" Scripps said kindly."]
["\"Best by test,\" the waitress smiled.", "Her face was lined and gray.", "She looks a little like that actress that died in Pittsburgh.", "What was her name?", "Lenore Ulric.", "In Peter Pan.", "That was it.", "They say she always went about veiled, Scripps thought.", "There was an interesting woman.", "Was it Lenore Ulric?", "Perhaps not.", "No matter."]
["\"Call him General Joffre,\" Scripps suggested."]
["\"Where was your home?\"", "Scripps asked."]
["\"Yes,\" Scripps answered simply."]

["The telegrapher looked at him curiously."]
["A man was inside the station, tapping something back of a wicketed window.", "He looked out at Scripps.", "Could he be a telegrapher?", "Something told Scripps that he was."]
["Scripps O'Neil had two wives.", "As he looked out of the windows, standing tall and lean and resilient with his own tenuous hardness, he thought of both of them.", "One lived in Mancelona and the other lived in Petoskey.", "He had not seen the wife who lived in Mancelona since last spring.", "He looked out at the snow-covered pump-yards and thought what spring would mean.", "With his wife in Mancelona Scripps often got drunk.", "When he was drunk he and his wife were happy.", "They would go down together to the railway station and walk out along the tracks, and then sit together and drink and watch the trains go by.", "They would sit under a pine-tree on a little hill that overlooked the railway and drink.", "Sometimes they drank all night.", "Sometimes they drank for a week at a time.", "It did them good.", "It made Scripps strong."]
["Scripps knew it was the factory.", "They weren't going to fool him on that.", "He walked up to the door.", "There was a sign on it:"]
["\"You were asking for the manager?\""]
["\"I'd like to speak to the manager,\" he said, standing quietly in the half-light."]
["\"You make a draft,\" he said."]
["The man called Yogi Johnson came over from the window.", "\"Glad to meet you,\" he said.", "He was a chunky, well-built fellow.", "One of the sort you see around almost anywhere.", "He looked as though he had been through things."]
["\"They work naked,\" Yogi said.", "\"They're searched as they go out.", "Sometimes they try and conceal the razor blades and take them out with them to bootleg.\""]
["Upstairs, apart in a separate room, two old men were working.", "Yogi opened the door.", "One of the old men looked over his steel spectacles and frowned."]
["\"It's meant a lot to me,\" Yogi answered.", "\"Come on and I'll show you around the works.\""]
["Scripps took her arm as they crossed the street.", "When his hand touched her arm Diana knew it was true.", "She would never hold him.", "A group of Indians passed them on the street.", "Were they laughing at her or was it some tribal jest?", "Diana didn't know.", "All she knew was that rhythm that beat into her brain.", "I can't hold him.", "I can't hold him."]
["\"It was about a little girl in Iowa,\" Diana said.", "She moved toward him.", "\"It was about people on the land.", "It reminded me a little of my own Lake Country.\""]
["\"Poor little chap,\" Scripps said.", "\"You could feel the cold too.\""]

["She had a man now.", "A man of her own.", "For her own.", "Could she keep him?", "Could she hold him for her own?", "She wondered."]
["\"Have you no hat?\"", "asked Scripps."]
["\"Let this be our wedding ceremony,\" the elderly waitress said.", "Scripps pressed her hand.", "\"You are my woman,\" he said simply."]
["The elderly waitress came out from behind the counter, and together, hand in hand, they strode out into the night."]
["\"My father went to Eton with Gladstone,\" the elderly waitress said.", "\"And now I am ready.\""]
